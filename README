## Results file descriptions

Separate files are provided for growth, lipid and pigmentation gene sets. 

geneset_promoter_variants
Variants identified by all three variant callers that pass coverage filters and are located within the promoter region of the genes of interest. 

geneset_nonsynonymous_variants
All non-synonymous variants located within the genes of interest (includes the reference and alternate allele)

geneset_genes_without_variants
Genes with zero non-synonymous variants.

geneset_variant_density
Genes with calculated non-synonymous variant density per kbp of coding regions.

## Explanation of rule names:

**bwa_index:**
Indexes reads. Necessary for alignment.

**cutadapt:**
Removes poly-G tails.

**bwa_mem:**
Aligns reads to reference genome.

**name_sort:**
Sorts aligned reads in .bam by name. Necessary for fixmate.

**fixmate:**
Fills in mate coordinates and mate related flags (requires a name-sorted bam). Necessary for compatibility with gatk.

**position_sort:**
Sorts by location (necessary for markduplicates).

**markduplicates:**
Marks duplicate alignments (necessary for Gatk compatibility).

**gunzip_ref:**
Unzips the reference genome.

**freebayes_call:**
Calls variants using freebayes.

**freebayes_filter:**
Filters freebayes variants using vcftools.

**addOrReplaceReadGroups:**
Adds read group tags (required for Gatk).

**bcftools_call:**
Calls variants with bcftools.

**bcftools_bcfToVcf:**
Converts bcf file to vcf.

**bcftools_filter:**
Filters bcftools variants using vcftools.

**join_bcf_vcfs:**
Joins bcftools .vcf files into a single vcf.

**promoter_regions:**
Creates .bed files describing promoter regions of the genes of interest from the .bed files describing the coordinates of the genes of interest creates in R. 

**picard_dict:**
Creates a sequence dictionary. Used to create region files necessary for parallelising bcftools_call. 

**gatk_make_region_files:**
Makes files used as input into gatk_call to parallelise gatk_call.

**bcf_make_region_files:**
Edits gatk region files to make files compatible with bcftools for variant calling.

**gatk_call:**
Call variants with gatk.

**gatk_filter:**
Filter variants called with Gatk using vcftools.

**join_gatk_vcfs:**
Join resulting gatk .vcf files together into a single vcf. 

**bedtools:**
Overlaps vcf files (variants) with .bed files specifying target genes.
